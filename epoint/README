Building package
========================================================================
You need OpenWRT source tree in order to build this package.

    git clone git://git.openwrt.org/15.05/openwrt.git
    cd openwrt

Add ePoint repository to the list of OpenWRT package feeds and update them.

    echo "src-git epoint \
        https://github.com/xoriole/openwrt-bitcoin-payment.git" >> \
        feeds.conf.default
    ./scripts/feeds update
    ./scripts/feeds install epoint # this will install dependencies as well

Make sure you have choosen the right target, and select epoint under 
Network category.

    make menuconfig

Finally, build OpenWRT.

    make

Binary .ipk packages will appear under ./bin/packages/mipsel.
Once you have the whole system built, you can recompile specific package 
much faster:

    TOPDIR=`pwd` make -C package/feeds/epoint/epoint


Installation
========================================================================
From respository (TEMPORARILY DOWN):

Add http://www.epointsystem.org/openwrt/packages/ as a package source and 
install epoint package.
You can do this from the web interface or from SSH command line interface.

    echo src epoint http://www.epointsystem.org/openwrt/packages/ >> \
        /etc/ipkg.conf
    ipkg update
    ipkg install epoint

Note: after installing package internet access from computers connected 
to the router will be immediately cut off. Try to visit any web page to 
get access for specified amount of time. If you want to simply disable 
access filter run "/etc/init.d/epoint stop".
